Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are five main branches of chemistry, namely: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.

Organic chemistry is the study of structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds, which includes not only hydrocarbons but also compounds with any number of other elements, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur. This branch of chemistry was originally limited to compounds produced by living organisms but has been broadened to include human-made substances such as plastics.

Inorganic chemistry deals with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. It is used in materials science, catalysis, and medicine.

Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of physical laws and concepts. It applies concepts from physics to chemical systems.

Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. It uses qualitative and quantitative methods.

Biochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. It is a laboratory-based science that combines aspects of both biology and chemistry. By using chemical knowledge and techniques, biochemists can understand and solve biological problems.

Chemical reactions are processes in which substances, the reactants, are transformed into different substances, the products. These reactions involve changes in the chemical bonds between atoms, and they are accompanied by changes in energy.

The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements with similar behavior are grouped in the same column.

Atomic theory states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting this nucleus.

Chemical bonding occurs when atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. The main types of chemical bonds include ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. Ionic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal, where electrons are transferred. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Metallic bonding is the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.

Thermodynamics in chemistry refers to the study of energy and its transformations. The laws of thermodynamics govern the direction of these transformations. The first law is the conservation of energy. The second law deals with entropy, a measure of disorder in a system.

Acids and bases are two important classes of compounds that participate in chemical reactions. An acid is a substance that donates a proton (H+), and a base is a substance that accepts a proton. The pH scale is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution.

Chemical kinetics is the study of the speed or rate of chemical reactions and the factors that influence this rate. It helps to understand how different conditions like temperature, pressure, and concentration affect the rate of reaction.

Equilibrium in chemistry refers to the state in which the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, so that the concentration of products and reactants remains constant over time.

Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. The substance in the greatest amount is the solvent, and the other substances are solutes. Solubility is the property of a substance to dissolve in a solvent.

Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the conservation of mass and the chemical equation representing the reaction.

Quantum chemistry applies quantum mechanics to chemical systems and explains the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules.

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. It is used to identify substances and to determine their composition and structure.

Materials chemistry involves the design and synthesis of new materials with specific properties and functions. It overlaps with physics, engineering, and nanotechnology.

Environmental chemistry studies the chemical processes occurring in the environment. It examines the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, water, and soil.

Industrial chemistry involves the development and optimization of chemical processes for manufacturing. It includes petrochemicals, polymers, and pharmaceuticals.

Nuclear chemistry is the study of the chemical and physical properties of elements as influenced by changes in the structure of the atomic nucleus. It includes radioactivity and nuclear reactions.

Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. It promotes sustainability and environmental safety.

Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are five main branches of chemistry, namely: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.

Organic chemistry is the study of structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds, which includes not only hydrocarbons but also compounds with any number of other elements, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur. This branch of chemistry was originally limited to compounds produced by living organisms but has been broadened to include human-made substances such as plastics.

Inorganic chemistry deals with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. It is used in materials science, catalysis, and medicine.

Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of physical laws and concepts. It applies concepts from physics to chemical systems.

Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. It uses qualitative and quantitative methods.

Biochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. It is a laboratory-based science that combines aspects of both biology and chemistry. By using chemical knowledge and techniques, biochemists can understand and solve biological problems.

Chemical reactions are processes in which substances, the reactants, are transformed into different substances, the products. These reactions involve changes in the chemical bonds between atoms, and they are accompanied by changes in energy.

The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements with similar behavior are grouped in the same column.

Atomic theory states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting this nucleus.

Chemical bonding occurs when atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. The main types of chemical bonds include ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. Ionic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal, where electrons are transferred. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Metallic bonding is the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.

Thermodynamics in chemistry refers to the study of energy and its transformations. The laws of thermodynamics govern the direction of these transformations. The first law is the conservation of energy. The second law deals with entropy, a measure of disorder in a system.

Acids and bases are two important classes of compounds that participate in chemical reactions. An acid is a substance that donates a proton (H+), and a base is a substance that accepts a proton. The pH scale is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution.

Chemical kinetics is the study of the speed or rate of chemical reactions and the factors that influence this rate. It helps to understand how different conditions like temperature, pressure, and concentration affect the rate of reaction.

Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with elements and compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are five main branches of chemistry, namely: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.

Organic chemistry is the study of structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds, which includes not only hydrocarbons but also compounds with any number of other elements, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur. This branch of chemistry was originally limited to compounds produced by living organisms but has been broadened to include human-made substances such as plastics.

Inorganic chemistry deals with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. It is used in materials science, catalysis, and medicine.

Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of physical laws and concepts. It applies concepts from physics to chemical systems.

Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. It uses qualitative and quantitative methods.

Biochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. It is a laboratory-based science that combines aspects of both biology and chemistry. By using chemical knowledge and techniques, biochemists can understand and solve biological problems.

Chemical reactions are processes in which substances, the reactants, are transformed into different substances, the products. These reactions involve changes in the chemical bonds between atoms, and they are accompanied by changes in energy.

The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements with similar behavior are grouped in the same column.

Atomic theory states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting this nucleus.

Chemical bonding occurs when atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. The main types of chemical bonds include ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. Ionic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal, where electrons are transferred. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Metallic bonding is the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.

Thermodynamics in chemistry refers to the study of energy and its transformations. The laws of thermodynamics govern the direction of these transformations. The first law is the conservation of energy. The second law deals with entropy, a measure of disorder in a system.

Acids and bases are two important classes of compounds that participate in chemical reactions. An acid is a substance that donates a proton (H+), and a base is a substance that accepts a proton. The pH scale is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution.

Chemical kinetics is the study of the speed or rate of chemical reactions and the factors that influence this rate. It helps to understand how different conditions like temperature, pressure, and concentration affect the rate of reaction.

Equilibrium in chemistry refers to the state in which the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, so that the concentration of products and reactants remains constant over time.

Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. The substance in the greatest amount is the solvent, and the other substances are solutes. Solubility is the property of a substance to dissolve in a solvent.

Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the conservation of mass and the chemical equation representing the reaction.

Quantum chemistry applies quantum mechanics to chemical systems and explains the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules.

Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are five main branches of chemistry, namely: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.

Organic chemistry is the study of structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds, which includes not only hydrocarbons but also compounds with any number of other elements, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, halogens, phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur. This branch of chemistry was originally limited to compounds produced by living organisms but has been broadened to include human-made substances such as plastics.

Inorganic chemistry deals with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. It is used in materials science, catalysis, and medicine.

Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of physical laws and concepts. It applies concepts from physics to chemical systems.

Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. It uses qualitative and quantitative methods.

Biochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. It is a laboratory-based science that combines aspects of both biology and chemistry. By using chemical knowledge and techniques, biochemists can understand and solve biological problems.

Chemical reactions are processes in which substances, the reactants, are transformed into different substances, the products. These reactions involve changes in the chemical bonds between atoms, and they are accompanied by changes in energy.

The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements with similar behavior are grouped in the same column.

Atomic theory states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting this nucleus.

Chemical bonding occurs when atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. The main types of chemical bonds include ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds. Ionic bonding occurs between a metal and a non-metal, where electrons are transferred. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Metallic bonding is the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of metal atoms.

Thermodynamics in chemistry refers to the study of energy and its transformations. The laws of thermodynamics govern the direction of these transformations. The first law is the conservation of energy. The second law deals with entropy, a measure of disorder in a system.

Acids and bases are two important classes of compounds that participate in chemical reactions. An acid is a substance that donates a proton (H+), and a base is a substance that accepts a proton. The pH scale is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution.

Chemical kinetics is the study of the speed or rate of chemical reactions and the factors that influence this rate. It helps to understand how different conditions like temperature, pressure, and concentration affect the rate of reaction.

Equilibrium in chemistry refers to the state in which the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, so that the concentration of products and reactants remains constant over time.

Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. The substance in the greatest amount is the solvent, and the other substances are solutes. Solubility is the property of a substance to dissolve in a solvent.

Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It is based on the conservation of mass and the chemical equation representing the reaction.

Quantum chemistry applies quantum mechanics to chemical systems and explains the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules.

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. It is used to identify substances and to determine their composition and structure.

Materials chemistry involves the design and synthesis of new materials with specific properties and functions. It overlaps with physics, engineering, and nanotechnology.

Environmental chemistry studies the chemical processes occurring in the environment. It examines the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, water, and soil.

Industrial chemistry involves the development and optimization of chemical processes for manufacturing. It includes petrochemicals, polymers, and pharmaceuticals.

Nuclear chemistry is the study of the chemical and physical properties of elements as influenced by changes in the structure of the atomic nucleus. It includes radioactivity and nuclear reactions.

Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. It promotes sustainability and environmental safety.
